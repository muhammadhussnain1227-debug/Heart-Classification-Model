# Heart-Classification-Model
Key highlights from the project:  Performed enhanced EDA with deep numerical data analysis to understand patterns and correlations.  Applied three different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.  Achieved an accuracy of 98% with Random Forest, making it the most effective model for this dataset.
